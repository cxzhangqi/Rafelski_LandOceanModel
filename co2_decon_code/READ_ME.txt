These codes will calculate the ocean uptake using a pulse-response function.  Then, it will calculate the residual land flux based on the CO2 emissions, change in atmospheric CO2 concentration, and the ocean uptake.

jooshildascale_annotate2.m is the main code that drives the subroutines.  Other codes are subroutines.

For many of the output variables, the first column is the date, and the second column is the variable value.  

The equations for the pulse response function ocean uptake model are from:
